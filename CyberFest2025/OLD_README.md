# UMC CTRL+ALT+DELETE TacoSec 2025

Welcome to the `UMC CTRL+ALT+DELETE TacoSec 2025`. Most challenges can be
solved with a browser and some know-how. Online tools might be helpful - but
not required.

The tasks are in the format of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. You will be
given a task and you need to find the flag. The flag is a string in the format
of `UMC{<answer>}`. The tasks are divided into categories and difficulty
levels. The capture flags shall be posted as a PM to
[Mikael Emanuelsson](mikael.emanuelsson@who-umc.org) for validation.

This year there are two different challenges to choose from.

Both exercises are pre-existing challenges with more or less complete
solutions available. Do restrain yourself from looking at the solutions
before you have tried to solve the challenges yourself. The goal is to learn
and have fun, not to get the fastest solution. But if you are stuck, feel
free to look at the solutions and try to understand how they work.

## OSINT - Open Source Intelligence
  
Accessible for everyone, no prerequisites. It will give you some tools to vet
information and insight into what the things you post online can be used for.

Beyond being fun and engaging, this OSINT exercise is highly valuable because:

* Real-World Relevance: The scenarios mirror actual cyber and physical
investigations, teaching skills directly applicable to cybersecurity,
journalism, law enforcement, and threat intelligence.
* Critical Thinking: Participants must analyze clues, cross-reference data,
and think creativelyâ€”skills essential for any analyst or investigator.
* Tool Familiarity: The tasks encourage the use of a wide range of open-source
tools and platforms, building practical experience with search engines,
mapping services, social media, and more.
* Data Literacy: By working with diverse data types (text, images, video,
metadata), participants improve their ability to extract, interpret, and
validate information.
* Ethical Hacking Mindset: The challenges foster an understanding of how public
information can be leveraged for both defense and offense, promoting
responsible and ethical use of OSINT.
*Teamwork and Communication: Many scenarios are best solved collaboratively,
enhancing communication and teamwork skills.

## API penetration test - One Request hosted by the [APISEC University](https://www.apisecuniversity.com/)

This challenge is more advanced and requires some knowledge of API development
and security. It will give you insight into how APIs can be exploited and how
to secure them.

This exercise focus on how to critically analyze an API on order to identify
potential security vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. What information is
exposed through the API? How can it be manipulated?

Skills needed:

* Critical thinking & problem-solving: The challenge is narrative-driven and
requires interpreting clues and making logical deductions.
Attention to detail: Small hints and patterns are likely embedded in the story
and data.
* Basic web navigation: Understanding how to explore websites, view source code,
or follow links.
* API testing tools: Familiarity with tools like Postman (a custom collection is
provided).
* Understanding of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, etc.
* Authentication tokens: Handling bearer tokens or API keys.
* JSON parsing: Reading and crafting JSON payloads.
* Basic scripting or automation (optional): For chaining requests or analyzing
responses.
