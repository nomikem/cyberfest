# CTRL+ALT+DELETE API penetration test

Suggested way of working:

* take some time to get everyone on the same page, token, sign in and successful response from userinfo api
* take some time to study the API documentation and get familiar with it.
* do the tasks one at a time.
* allow time for "self exploring" - but remember the group discussion is highly valuable if stuck, for fun and learning and a prioritized part of the session.
* there are video guides as references - look at them when the GROUP is in agreement of being stuck. The [This CTF Teaches You Everything About Hacking an API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tyqvl-GSNQ ) is divided into sections so its easier to "cheat" just for one challenge at a time. After getting the solution - discuss in the group why, other options?
* consider the amount of data returned by API, there can be lots

Worth noting:

* do not use a mail address that you use for something real - good practice not to share personal information just because (challenge works just fine with fake data)
* automation - if needed AI is an excellent tool to create a simple script to automate
* text in the challenge can be used for clues and hints
