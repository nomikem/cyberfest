# UMC CyberFest 2025

Welcome to the UMC CyberFest 2025. Most challenges can ve solved with a browser
and some know-how. Online tools might be helpful - but not required.

The tasks are in the format of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. You will be
given a task and you need to find the flag. The flag is a string in the format
of `UMC{<answer>}`. The tasks are divided into categories and difficulty
levels. The capture flags shall be posted as a PM to
[Mikael Emanuelsson](mikael.emanuelsson@who-umc.org) for validation.

This year there are two different challenges to choose from.

* OSINT - Open Source Intelligence
  
  Accessible for everyone, no prerequisites. It will give you some tools to vet
  information and insight into what the things you post online can be used for.

* API penetration test - One Request hosted by the [APISEC University](https://www.apisecuniversity.com/)

  This challenge is more advanced and requires some knowledge of API development and
security. It will give you insight into how APIs can be exploited and how
to secure them.

Both exercises are pre-existing challenges with more or less complete
solutions available. Do restrain yourself from looking at the solutions
before you have tried to solve the challenges yourself. The goal is to learn
and have fun, not to get the fastest solution. But if you are stuck, feel
free to look at the solutions and try to understand how they work.
