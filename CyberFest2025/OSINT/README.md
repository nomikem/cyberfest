## Roomba incident

Roomba vacuums, especially higher-end models, use sensors and cameras to map
the layout of your home. This data can include:

* Room dimensions
* Furniture placement
* High-traffic areas
* This mapping data is stored and can be transmitted to iRobot’s cloud
services.

In 2022, it was reported that images taken by Roomba test units (including
photos of people in private settings) were leaked and ended up on social media
platforms. These images were captured by devices used by paid testers and were
meant for internal AI training purposes. However, the leak highlighted the
risks of using real-world data for machine learning without robust safeguards
