# Propaganda broadcast

* Difficulty: 2 (5)
* Intended tools: Search engines, amateur radio

Roombas everywhere are using social media to try and spread COVID propaganda about 5G infecting the public...basically saying people will start emitting Wi-Fi radiation.

However, a new tactic has just hit our radar. We've just received reports of propaganda spreading through amateur radio. We're unsure of the call-sign, but the caller reported the following statement:

"I was on the phone to my wife in Florence, Alabama. In the background of her HAM radio, I heard someone calling himself 'Scotty' in some weird-ass robotic voice, clamoring on about that 'demic giving everyone 5G and sorts."

That's all we have to go off for now. Find the call-sign and submit it to us so we can start tracking down their home address.
