We've received a report that a Roomba has been detected traveling through Texas, USA. All we know is that they're likely between Houston, San Antonio or Austin. Which one, we don't know.

All we have is a video taken from inside the moving vehicle. You need to piece together the surroundings to give us the exact road name they were traveling on.
