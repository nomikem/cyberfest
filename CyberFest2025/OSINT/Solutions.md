## 08 COVID in transit

Search all rollercoaster (yes, you probably tried bridges and sprinklers too!) until you find one that is similar, in the area of Houston, San Antonio or Austin. Can chop up video frame by frame to identify their general characteristics. Then assess design and street view attributes, before looking at foliage, street signs and streets lights to line up the distance with the video. Once this is done, identify your location and note that if is the particular street as TEXAS 151 Access Road.

Long Version:
One of the videos has her singing in the car and a rollercoaster in the background, it was the San Antonio Sea World rollercoaster.

Yeah I thought it was a bridge but inverted the colors and saw the zigzag in the middle. Went thru all bridges and rollercoaster in TX but noticed from a google search it looked similar at Sea World.

The SeaWorld rollercoaster is in the background of the video. It has the same number of rungs and central platform zig-zag steps as in the video.
There is a stop sign in the location which is also appears in the video.
There is a sign for "inline retail & pad sites" in the video which is also at the location on that road. https://www.google.com.au/maps/@29.4557201,-98.6885318,3a,75y,250.78h,95.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1seoQf_Fu56zlyX8994uEu0g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192
The same street lights exist in the video as with the geographical reference.
