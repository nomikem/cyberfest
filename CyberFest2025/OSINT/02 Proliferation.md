The Roombas are trying to gain the upper hand over the human population. We believe they're going to target pivotal industries such as real estate, critical infrastructure, information security and healthcare. We don't know who yet, but we know it's a group of close friends and all are infected with COVID-19.

We need to enact Contact Tracing - finding every detail about their lives in order to predict and contain their movements. No one has heard from them since March. We must build up details about them for the agents to then take over. That's where you come in.

Our first piece of intelligence is a gentleman by the name of Marc Hevis - a co-owner of Hevis Properties Pty Ltd. We have agents ready on the ground, and others covering all his other social media - your task is to find his Twitter account.
