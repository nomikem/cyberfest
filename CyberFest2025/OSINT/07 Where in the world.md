Subject: Possible compromise - Facebook superadmin account Message: Got it, thanks. We were right; breached in a few online dumps; trust Zuck to have "I_hate_myspace_tom" as his password. Long story short, we can link this to the breach. Problem is, we're unsure exactly which global node server the roomba's are going to target.

We did however find this image on the server, as the most recently changed file. It could be a geo-map of where they're planning to strike next, or it could simply be the ex-admin's next holiday destination. Either way, we need to know where that is NOW to start targeted keyword analysis. There's no metadata on this one - you're going to have to recognize the physical features.

Find the source of the image online, and I'll take care of the rest.
