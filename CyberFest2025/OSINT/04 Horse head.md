It's 12:57am. You get an SMS from your red team manager - "Hey, we have a
situation... Call me.".

Stepping out of bed and into the sleepy lights of the city, you tighten your
hoodie and hit call. - "Hey. So a crime-stoppers report just came in, and
apparently a passerby spotted a Roomba trying to cover up a message on
a... yeah this is going to sound weird... horse. Said something like 'the horse
had a name on its side', but couldn't remember what it said on the red
background. He said it was no more than 200m past the railroad bridge in
Sundbyberg. Located on the side of the road. Find the horse, find what name was
on its coat. Once you've done that, we can put out an All-Points Bulletin for it.

Find and submit the name on the horses' coat to notify local law enforcement in
the area.
