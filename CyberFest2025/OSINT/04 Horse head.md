It's 12:57am. You get an SMS from your red team manager - "Hey, we have a situation... Call me.".

Stepping out of bed and into the sleepy lights of the city, you tighten your hoodie and hit call. - "Hey. So a crime-stoppers report just came in, and apparently a passerby spotted a Roomba trying to implant a consciousness into a... yeah this is going to sound weird... horse. Said something like 'the horse had a name on its side', but couldn't remember what. He said it was no more than 200m past the BP Petrol station in Mansfield, VIC on his way to Mt Buller. Located on the side of the road. Find the horse, find what name was on its coat. Once you've done that, we can put out an All-Points Bulletin for it."

Find and submit the name on the horses' coat to notify local law enforcement in the area.
