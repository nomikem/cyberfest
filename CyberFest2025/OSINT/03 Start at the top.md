Possible compromise - Facebook superadmin account Message: We've received an alert from CERT Australia of a possible superadmin compromise within Facebook's backend servers. As you know, they control a number of global node servers and if the roombas get access to pushing content....who knows what they might do. But we're currently looking at Roombas trying to learn the genetic structure and makeup of the novel coronavirus...from various supercookies tracking scientists browser history research. Of course, this can all be found out via the GraphQL API.

Facebook being facebook, they're not providing any word at this point. However, combining this with the thousands of Federal Police ACORNS reports we've had in the past few days, it's possible. Let's start from the top. Find Mark Zuckerbergs email address and submit it into the portal; we'll run some automated checks to see if it's appeared in any 3rd party breach sites.
