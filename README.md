## What to Expect

Most challenges can be solved using just a browser and some curiosity. Online tools might help, but they’re not required. The tasks are designed for all skill levels — whether you're a beginner or already have some experience.

Each challenge hides a **flag** in the format `UMC{<answer>}`. Once you find it, send it via PM to Mikael Emanuelsson for validation.

This year, you can choose between two exciting tracks:

---

### OSINT – Open Source Intelligence

No prerequisites needed — just your investigative mindset! This challenge teaches you how publicly available information can be used in both ethical hacking and real-world investigations.

**Why try OSINT?**

- **Real-world relevance** in cybersecurity, journalism, and threat intelligence  
- **Critical thinking** and data literacy  
- **Tool familiarity** with open-source platforms  
- **Ethical hacking mindset**  
- **Teamwork and communication** opportunities

### API Penetration Test – “One Request”  
Hosted by APISEC University

This more advanced challenge is perfect for those with some knowledge of APIs and web technologies. You’ll explore how APIs can be exploited — and how to defend them.

**Skills you’ll practice:**

- Analyzing and testing APIs  
- Using tools like Postman  
- Understanding HTTP methods and authentication  
- Parsing JSON and chaining requests  
- Thinking like an attacker — ethically

## The Goal

This isn’t about speed — it’s about learning, experimenting, communicating and having fun. While solutions exist online, we encourage you to try solving the challenges yourself first. If you get stuck, feel free to peek and learn how others approached it.

So, are you ready to CTRL+ALT+DELETE your assumptions and level up your cyber skills?

## When and Where

We strongly encourage you to be at site, although not required. You can participate in the entire event, but you can join at any time.
